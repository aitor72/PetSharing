System must contemplate three types of users:
o Anonymous.
o Registered.
o Administrators.
● Anonymous users should be able to view:
o Personal pages of registered users, which shows the public information and
tweets of a particular user.
o Global timeline which shows either latest or most popular tweets.
● Registered users should be able to view:
o Personal pages of registered users.
o Their profile, where they can view and edit their own information (e.g. Name,
username, profile picture etc.),
o Global timeline.
o Personalized timeline which shows tweets only from the users they follow.
● Each user can publish tweets, edit and also delete them.
● Users can follow/unfollow other users.
o There should be a mechanism for new users to find and follow other
registered users. This could be a “who to follow” page showing a list of
registered users or they can find users from the global timeline of popular
tweets. You can also implement a search mechanism for this.
o You should create a view where all the followed users are listed in order to
access their public personal page or unfollow them.
● An admin user can edit/delete:
o User accounts.
o Personal pages, profiles and Tweets
