### Por hacer:

System must contemplate three types of users:

- [ ] Anonymous
- [ ] Registered
- [ ] Administrators


● Anonymous users should be able to view:

- [ ] Personal pages of registered users, which shows the public information and
  tweets of a particular user.
- [X] Global timeline which shows either latest or most popular tweets.


● Registered users should be able to view:

- [ ] Personal pages of registered users.
- [x] Their profile, where they can view and edit their own information (e.g. Name,
  username, profile picture etc.),
  (TENIM L'EDIT USER A PART PERO ESTA FET)
- [X]  Global timeline.
- [ ] Personalized timeline which shows tweets only from the users they follow.
- [ ] Each user can publish tweets, edit and also delete them.(FALTA EDIT)
- [X]  Users can follow/unfollow other users.
- [ ] There should be a mechanism for new users to find and follow other
  registered users. This could be a “who to follow” page showing a list of
  registered users or they can find users from the global timeline of popular
  tweets. You can also implement a search mechanism for this. 
- [ ] You should create a view where all the followed users are listed in order to
  access their public personal page or unfollow them.



● An admin user can edit/delete:

- [ ] User accounts
- [ ] Personal pages, profiles and Tweets
